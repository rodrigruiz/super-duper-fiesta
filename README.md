A neutrino telescope detects an upgoing cascade event with an energy of 100 TeV. What is the probability that this event was produced by a cosmic neutrino?

This project was started to answer that question. For this, we use simple parametrisations of the neutrino cross sections, atmospheric neutrino fluxes, and BY distributions.
